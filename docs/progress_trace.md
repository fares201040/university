# Progress Trace: Event-Driven Integration

## Current Status
- Shared event models and base classes are implemented in the `events/` package.
- Redis event publisher and consumer classes are ready and documented.
- Example handler and usage for event consumption are in place.
- Integration with API Gateway and microservices for event-driven communication is planned, but not yet implemented.

## Next Steps
- Start with authentication setup in the API Gateway (Keycloak + OAuth2).
- After authentication is enforced, proceed to event-driven integration.
