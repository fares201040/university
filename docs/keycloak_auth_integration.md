# Keycloak Authentication Integration Plan

This document outlines the steps and best practices for integrating Keycloak authentication (OAuth2) into the API Gateway using FastAPI.

## Library Choice
- **Recommended:** Use `python-jose` for JWT validation and FastAPI's built-in OAuth2 support for flexibility and transparency.
- Optionally, use `fastapi-keycloak` for a higher-level integration if you want more automation.

## Integration Steps

### 1. Keycloak Setup
- Configure a realm, client, and users in Keycloak admin UI.
- Set the client to use the Authorization Code flow.
- Obtain the Keycloak server URL, realm, and client ID for your API Gateway.

### 2. FastAPI OAuth2 Dependency
- Use FastAPI's `OAuth2PasswordBearer` for token extraction.
- Use `python-jose` to decode and validate JWTs from Keycloak.
- Add a dependency to all protected endpoints in the API Gateway.

### 3. JWT Validation Logic
- Fetch the Keycloak public key (JWKS endpoint) at startup.
- Validate the JWT signature, expiration, audience, and issuer.
- Extract user info and roles from the token claims.

### 4. Example Implementation
- Provide a reusable dependency for token validation.
- Protect all event-publishing endpoints with this dependency.

### 5. Documentation
- Document how to configure Keycloak and the API Gateway for authentication.
- Reference the book and example codebase for best practices.

## Next Step
- Scaffold the authentication dependency and JWT validation logic in the API Gateway.
- Document the integration in `docs/keycloak_auth_integration.md`.

**This approach is secure, flexible, and aligns with modern FastAPI and microservices best practices.**
