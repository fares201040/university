# Implementation Roadmap

This document provides a step-by-step guide for implementing the event-driven microservices architecture, referencing the book and example codebase.

## Step 1: Architecture & Event-Driven Design
- Review `architecture_overview.md` for the big picture.
- Reference book chapters on microservices architecture and event-driven design.

## Step 2: Event Schema & Contracts
- Define event types and schemas in `event_schema_and_contracts.md`.
- Reference book sections on message contracts and versioning.

## Step 3: API Gateway as OAuth Client & Event Publisher
- Implement authentication and event publishing as described in `api_gateway_design.md`.
- Use book examples for OAuth2 and event publishing patterns.

## Step 4: Microservice Event Consumers
- Implement event consumers in each microservice as described in `microservice_event_consumers.md`.
- Use OOP and patterns from the book and codebase.

## Step 5: Shared Event Models & OOP Patterns
- Create shared event models and base classes as in `shared_event_models_oop.md`.
- Reference book examples for extensibility and maintainability.

## Step 6: Scalability, Caching, and Reliability
- Integrate Redis for both event brokering and caching as in `scalability_and_caching.md`.
- Follow book best practices for scaling and reliability.

## Step 7: Example Event Flow
- Test the end-to-end flow using the example in `example_event_flow.md`.
- Use this as a template for additional event-driven use cases.

## Reference
- All steps are based on the book "Building Python Microservices with FastAPI" and the codebase in "Building-Python-Microservices-with-FastAPI-main".
