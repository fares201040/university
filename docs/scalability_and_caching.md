# Scalability and Caching

This document explains how Redis is used for both event-driven messaging and caching, and how the system is designed for scalability and reliability.

## Redis as Broker and Cache
- **Broker:** Redis Pub/Sub channels are used for event-driven communication between the API Gateway and microservices.
- **Cache:** Redis can cache frequently accessed data (e.g., user sessions, book availability) to reduce database load and improve performance.

## Scalability
- Multiple instances of microservices can subscribe to the same Redis channels for horizontal scaling.
- The API Gateway and microservices can be scaled independently.
- Event processing should be idempotent to handle retries and duplicates.

## Reliability
- Use Redis persistence and replication for high availability.
- Implement error handling and retry logic in event consumers.

## Best Practices
- Separate channels for different event types.
- Use TTL (time-to-live) for cached data where appropriate.
- Monitor Redis performance and health.

## Reference
- Design and patterns are based on the book and example codebase.
